// This test file has been temporarily removed due to incorrect configuration.
// It was using port 3001 instead of the standard port 3000 and hardcoded credentials.
//
// Provider group functionality should be tested using proper test utilities 
// from playwright-utils.ts with the correct setup and user management.
//
// TODO: Rewrite this test using proper test patterns:
// - Use the login fixture from playwright-utils.ts  
// - Use proper test user creation
// - Use correct port configuration
// - Follow the patterns from other e2e tests like onboarding.test.ts

export {}; // Make this a module
